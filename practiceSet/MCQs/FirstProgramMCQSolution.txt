10.
Answer: c) It will be treated as a string.

13.
Answer: b) It reads input from the keyboard.
Explanation: System.in is connected to the keyboard by default for standard input.

14.
Answer: b) To enhance I/O performance by minimizing direct interaction with the output device
Explanation: Buffering reduces the number of interactions with the output device, improving efficiency.

15.
Answer: a) Yes, but only one can be executed at runtime.
Explanation: Multiple classes can have a main method, but you must specify which class to execute.
