5 Coding Questions on Type Conversion and Casting

1 Write a program to demonstrate implicit and explicit type casting. Example: Convert an int to double implicitly and a double to int explicitly.

2 Write a program to safely convert an int to a short without losing data. If the value exceeds the range of short, print an error message.

3 Write a program that takes a character as input and converts it to its ASCII value using type conversion.

4 Write a program that converts a double value to an int and prints both values. Example: double d = 123.456; should print both the original value and the truncated value.

5 Write a program to convert a long to a byte and demonstrate overflow. Example: Assign a value greater than the maximum byte range to a long and observe the result when cast to byte.
